Spring Microservices

What is the difference between microservices and web services?
Take an example of a utility service such as an IP service - give an IP address as input and return the location of the IP address.
The makers of such a utility service did not think where exactly this service would be used. It was built and whoever wants to use it, could use it in their application.
In the case of microservices, services are built for a specific reason. For example, in an e-commerce website, creating a shopping cart could be a microservice. They are not developed as a utility, but more for the need of such a service.

Creating a spring boot application
